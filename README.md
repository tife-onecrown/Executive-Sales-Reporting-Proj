### Project Overview

As the designated data analyst for DTLM Retail, the Sales Director has outlined a comprehensive set of requirements aimed at extracting actionable insights from the provided dataset. The primary objectives of this project encompass calculating essential metrics for every order, generating various reports, constructing a dashboard, and highlighting key insights.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Executive Sales Reporting Project.xlsb" containing detailed information about each sale made by the company

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
- Performed Revenue and Profit calculations for each order in the dataset

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:

- Identifying the top-performing products based on revenue.
- Determine the contribution of each product category to the overall revenue.
- Identify the top-performing sales teams in terms of revenue.
- What are the top revenue-generating states along with their respective population and median income?


### Insights

1. The product category that made the most revenue is DECORATIVES with a total Profit of $3,804,344.
2. The Sales team that made the most revenue from Decoratives  is SHAWN COOKS.
3. The relationship between the Revenue, Population and Median Income of the states is that the more Population in a state, the higher the Revenue. Also, the higher the Median Income, the higher the Revenue


### Recommendations

Based on the insights from the dataset, here are some recommendations:

1. I suggest that we develop targeted marketing campaigns to promote "DECORATIVES" and attract a broader audience and also explore market expansion opportunities to diversify revenue streams.
2. Recognize and reward the efforts of the SHAWN COOKS sales team for their success in generating the highest revenue from Decoratives. We could consider analyzing their strategies and best practices to share with other teams or to replicate success in other product categories.
3. We could consider segmenting marketing and sales efforts based on state demographics. Focus more on states with larger populations and higher median incomes, as they tend to generate higher revenue. Tailor promotional strategies to resonate with the preferences and purchasing power of residents in these states.
4. Engage with customers in states with higher populations and median incomes to build stronger relationships and loyalty. This could involve personalized communications, exclusive offers, or targeted events that resonate with the demographic profile of these states.
5. While focusing on top-performing products and lucrative markets, we could also continue to explore opportunities for diversification and innovation. Introduce new products or services that cater to evolving consumer preferences and trends, ensuring sustained growth and competitiveness in the market.
